# Pizza Retail System

## Introduction

Nowadays, pizza delivery systems of various global food chains is becoming increasingly incompetent and redundant. Thus, we decided to create a pizza delivery system which will be retail-based and will allow the company to place orders, modify menu and keep a tab on inventory.
This project was built in collboartion with Siddhartha Jaiswal and Manav Jain.


## Repository Information

This repository consists of multiple python files:
- Intialize.py is to intialize the values for the ordering system. 
- main_menu.py is the main file on which the project runs and is used for placing an order for the customers as well as modifying the menu and managing inventory.
- inventory_sql.py is to view the inventory for the company seperately without opening the main menu file


This pizza retail system for companies is terminal-based. The programming language used is Python and SQLlite for database. Even after the python files are closed, the database will persist in a specific system as it is saved in the SQL Database


## Methods

- Placing an order involved everything from name, address to toppings and quantity.
- Menu modification and Inventory view also allowed to add or replace products or change selling or cost price of the raw materials.
