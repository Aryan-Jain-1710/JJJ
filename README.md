# Pizza Retail System

## Introduction

Nowadays, pizza delivery systems of various global food chains is becoming increasingly incompetent and redundant. Thus, we decided to create a pizza delivery system which will be retail-based and will allow the company to place orders, modify menu and keep a tab on inventory.
This project was built in collboartion with Siddhartha Jaiswal and Manav Jain.

This repository consists of multiple python files:
- Intialize.py is to intialize the values for the ordering system.
- main_menu.py is the main file on which the project runs and is used for placing an order for the customers as well as modifying the menu and managing inventory.


The ordering system is terminal-based. The programming language use is python and SQLlite for database.


## Methods

- Placing an order involved everything from name, address to toppings and quantity.
- Menu modification and Inventory view also allowed to add or replace products or change selling or cost price of the raw materials.
